# DrugListPrice

DrugListPrice is dedicated to scraping up-to-date list prices for drugs eligible for reimbursement from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA). 
Taiwan has successfully operated a national health insurance system for over 20 years. New drug reimbursement schemes are determined through the Expert Advisory Meeting and the Pharmaceutical Benefit and Reimbursement Scheme (PBRS) Joint Committee. 
In this process, new drugs cases or criteria change cases (indications expansionsusually with price adjustments) following PBRS resolution approvals, are documented in the input file as an example.
